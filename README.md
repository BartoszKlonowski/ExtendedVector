This project is the extension of `std::vector<T>` from STL but based on .NET Framework `List<T>`.
<br/>It means, that all of features and methods provided by `List<T>` should also be available in the implemented `std::vector<T>` extension: `Cx::Vector<T>`.

The goal of this project was to create the tool which will make the usage of standard `std::vector<T>` even easier when it comes to complex yet typical operations done on collections which are currently not a part of the *vector* header, but require more includes and more LOC.

Please check the official documentation of [std::vector\<T>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) and [System.Collections.Generic.List\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netframework-4.8) to see the two bases of this product and how it connects both of them.
  
---
  
## Installation & Usage ##

To use this tool:
* Download the archived release package,
* Unpack the release package and place the main implementation's header (which is *Vector.hpp*) in any directory within your project (for example "*Dependencies*" or "*3rdParties*"),
* Include the *Vector.hpp* header in your implementation and call the `Cx::Vector<T>` to instantiate the container.

**NOTE:**
<br/>ExtendedVector already uses several other includes from standard library, such as the following:
<br/>*vector*, *iostream*, *algorithm*, *functional*, *array*

## Documentation ##

This project fills the gap between the `std::vector<T>` and `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>` which means that it brings all the features already available in the `List<T>` to the `std::vector<T>`, making a `Cx::Vector<T>` in result.
Each method implemented within the `Cx::Vector<T>` corresponds to the same method in the `List<T>` from .NET.
<br/>So to check the method's documentation in details please check the .NET's official documentation of `List<T>` [methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netframework-4.8#methods) section.
<br/>The methods already available in the original `std::vector<T>` are still available unchanged when using `Cx::Vector<T>`.

**NOTE:** Each method implemented in the *Vector.hpp* header are also covered with the *doxygen* comments (`///`), so each code editor supporting displaying them will show the method documented each time it is called within your code.

The presentation of some of the Cx::Vector abilities is done in the *Examples* project's source code files.
<br/>So to fully check the abilities of the ExtendedVector utility, please go to the [Examples](https://github.com/BartoszKlonowski/ExtendedVector/tree/main/Examples) directory.

Below you can find just a short demo of what the *ExtendedVector* project is all about and what are the example benefits of using it:
```cpp
    Cx::Vector<std::string> vector;
    vector.push_back( "Hello" );
    vector.push_back( "World!" );
    Print( vector );

    vector.clear();
    Print( vector );

    vector = { "Elephant", "Cat", "Mouse", "Wolf", "Dinosaur", "Tiger", "Dog", "Eagle", "Cow", "Snake" };
    Print( vector );

    auto animalsByCLetter = vector.FindAll( []( const std::string& animal )->bool
        {
            return animal[0] == 'C';
        } );
    Print( animalsByCLetter );

    vector.RemoveAll( []( const std::string& element )->bool
        {
            return element.length() > 4;
        } );
    Print( vector );

    vector.ForEach( []( std::string& element )
        {
            element = std::string("Animal:") + element;
        } );
    Print( vector );

    if( vector.Contains("Animal:Dog") )
        std::cout << "\nIndex of 'Animal:Dog' is: " << vector.IndexOf( "Animal:Dog" ) << std::endl;

    auto indexOfCow = vector.IndexOf( "Animal:Cow" );
    vector.RemoveAt( indexOfCow );
    Print( vector );
```

which gives the following output:

```
Printing Cx::Vector with 2 elements inside:
Hello World!

Printing Cx::Vector with 0 elements inside:


Printing Cx::Vector with 10 elements inside:
Elephant Cat Mouse Wolf Dinosaur Tiger Dog Eagle Cow Snake

Printing Cx::Vector with 2 elements inside:
Cat Cow

Printing Cx::Vector with 4 elements inside:
Cat Wolf Dog Cow

Printing Cx::Vector with 4 elements inside:
Animal:Cat Animal:Wolf Animal:Dog Animal:Cow

Index of 'Animal:Dog' is: 2

Printing Cx::Vector with 3 elements inside:
Animal:Cat Animal:Wolf Animal:Dog
```
